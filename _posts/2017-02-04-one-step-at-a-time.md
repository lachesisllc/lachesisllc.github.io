Over the past few months, we have worked with two high-performing clients who were trying to improve their financial results. Despite the fact that these clients operate in completely different industries and serve completely different customers, there are similarities in the difficulties we faced while helping these companies.

* First, after many years of impressive growth both companies struggle with data visibility. There was very little transparency between financial results and operational data. Thus, by the time operating issues manifested themselves in the financial results too much time passed and the operational problems became more deeply rooted.
* Second, employees within these two companies sensed that they were sailing in troubled waters. These employees did not have visibility to operational or financial data to help guide and define their daily activities, so they formed their own theories about what was going wrong. As more time passed, these theories grew in number and gained momentum. Well meaning employees began to take action to solve the "real problem".
* Third, executives who were also suffering from a lack of data visibility, were not exactly sure why financial performance was sluggish. However, they wanted to address the concerns being communicated by their employees. Each action-oriented directive designed to fix a problem pulled the organization in a different direction. Despite the increase in hard work, the financial slide continued.

The urge to take action in a crisis can be strong, and rightfully so. However, as we worked through these problems with our clients, it was a disciplined, data driven approach that won the day. Taking the time to figure out what data was needed to identify the cause of the problem versus simply using the data that was available was an important first step. Next, we presented the data to key employees in a way that allowed us to collectively and calmly dispel theory after theory. Finally, with the noise out of the system, the organization could concentrate on solving the operational issues that were primarily responsible for the poor financial results. While this process seems to take time, using clear and accurate data to solve what can be very emotional issues will get you to the top faster than running full speed up hill.
