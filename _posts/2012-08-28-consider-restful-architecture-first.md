Why should REST be first on your list when designing an enterprise solution?  For me, it comes down to available resources.  Most of the enterprises I work in have a large talent pool of senior architects.  These folks just “get it”.  They understand their environment and how to solve problems for their business domain.  They also have a large talent pool of developers with 1 to 5 years of experience (on or offshore) at their disposal.  However, senior developers that have a deep understanding of complex patterns, real world system integration experience, and solid architectural fundamentals are usually in short supply.  Let’s face it, senior developers are expensive – and in high demand.

Enter a solution based on a RESTful architecture.  It is built on the most scalable system known – and it does it using a protocol that every developer is well versed in “HTTP”.  Most major programming platforms have excellent tools to build upon HTTP and every device out there understands it.  However, unlike architectures built on middleware solutions that help manage and or enforce communication contracts, protocols and consistency, RESTful solutions require governance to be managed loosely.

Taking a step back – this means to successfully implement a RESTful solution  we need excellent architects to manage the governance, no specialized developers to manage middleware and complex integration points, and a large pool of developers that understand how to develop for the web.
Designing a solution in an enterprise environment is always a series of trade-offs.  The best solution strikes a balance between meeting the business objective, cost, time to market, and maintenance.  RESTful solutions can go a long way to reducing cost, time to market and simplifying maintenance.  There are many other reasons to consider REST that I’ll post more on later – but the resource balance is what convinced me to consider REST first – all other options second.
