excerpt: 'A core service we provide our clients is building managerial dashboards that are aligned with strategy so that executives can gain more visibility into the impact their strategic decisions are having on the organization. As we head down this path of discussion with our clients, one of the first statements we hear is "I can’t get to the data so the dashboards won’t help me".  The not so funny thing about this statement is the underlying assumption that it is clearly known what data is needed to drive the business forward. We rarely hear somebody say "Let’s first figure out what data we need and then we can build the dashboards."  Having a sound strategy is of little value if the organization is not measuring the right things. Everybody in the organization must understand what he or she should be doing and why it is important to the overall competitive advantage. Crucial to this is measuring and communicating performance around the key activities.'

A core service we provide our clients is building managerial dashboards that are aligned with strategy so that executives can gain more visibility into the impact their strategic decisions are having on the organization. As we head down this path of discussion with our clients, one of the first statements we hear is "I can’t get to the data so the dashboards won’t help me". The not so funny thing about this statement is the underlying assumption that it is clearly known what data is needed to drive the business forward. We rarely hear somebody say "Let's first figure out what data we need and then we can build the dashboards." Having a sound strategy is of little value if the organization is not measuring the right things. Everybody in the organization must understand what he or she should be doing and why it is important to the overall competitive advantage. Crucial to this is measuring and communicating performance around the key activities. 

So, while the answer as to which data is needed for a dashboard seems very simple (thus, the assumptions) I believe it is one of the more complex pieces to the puzzle. Businesses are constantly being faced with new challenges: new entrants into the market, new service offerings, new technology. All of these things disrupt how a business has traditionally operated. Constantly questioning what activities within the organization are key to success and how to measure performance on those activities is both necessary and challenging. Using the same KPIs year after year after year is a dangerous practice that can blind the company from opportunities or, even worse, make it impossible for them to be captured. We have all heard the phrase “you manage what you measure”. So what are you managing if you are measuring the wrong things?
