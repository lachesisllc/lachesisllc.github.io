The other day, I was hitting golf balls with a friend of mine. This friend played professional golf for a few years; as in he earned his living by competing against the best golfers in the US. As I watched him hit about 10 perfectly struck golf balls down range I noticed that the only thing to which he was paying attention was his aim. He methodically placed his feet so that they were perfectly aligned with his target line. He took time to ensure that his shoulders were in unison with his feet. He then carefully placed his hands on the club and spent several seconds making sure that his club face was in line with his feet and shoulders. Once he was sure that all major components of his setup were in sync and pointing in the exact same direction, he took the club back, swung through and launched the ball perfectly towards the target. For those of you who play golf, you might agree that building a golf swing to produce well struck shots can be a complicated task. When I asked him why he was so particular about the seemingly minor details of where he placed his feet he simply replied; “a solid shot is useful only if it hits the target.” Put another way, the thousands of hours he devoted to building a swing that can produce solidly struck shots are wasted unless he is hyper focused on where he is aiming those shots.

It struck me that there are some parallels between my friend’s approach to golf and how good executives run their companies. The best organizations are not only very focused on how they are doing what they do they also spend time making sure they are properly aimed. A disciplined and rigorous approach to building a strategy is akin to my friend’s painstaking approach to checking his aim. Every part of the organization must understand the target and must work together in unison towards that target. If the organization is working well but is pointed in the wrong direction, the results can be disastrous. So, my takeaway from this little episode is the understanding that time spent checking our clients' aim is time well spent.
