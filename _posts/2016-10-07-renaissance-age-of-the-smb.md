I believe we’re entering a renaissance age for the agile small to medium business (SMB).  You know, those great $5M -$200M companies that are the backbone of local communities.  Regional banks, manufacturing companies, fabrication shops, OEMs, and even the craft brewer and distillers to name a few.  Why am I so bullish on SMBs now?  Advances in information technology have shattered the barrier to entry to tools and markets that were previously only available to fortune 500 companies.  You no longer need a billion-dollar revenue stream to support the overhead advanced collaboration, productivity, and analytics tools required.  Office 365 puts collaboration and productivity tools in offices of any size located anywhere.  Advanced machine learning techniques that just 5 years ago cost upwards of $500k to put into production are now available for just a few dollars a month thanks to inexpensive Cloud Computing.  Mobile devices connect everyone to the office without costly VPNs.  Honestly the list just keeps going.

I’ve spent the last 15 years working with some fantastic fortune 500 companies, witnessed firsthand the competitive advantage their IT infrastructure provided, but also saw how their sheer size makes it difficult to adapt quickly to take full advantage of new opportunities.  I won’t pick on anyone in particular, but as you can imagine, getting critical mass in a large committee to change the status quo takes a dedicated executive and a monumental amount of effort.  To complicate things even further, once the direction is set and the marching orders are given, technology and the market opportunity all too often shifts before the initiative is fully realized.  I’m convinced change will continue to come at an increasingly rapid pace exacerbating this scenario.

SMBs however, can turn on a dime to take advantage of a new opportunity in comparison.  The nature of being closely held and driven by a cohesive management group that is very close to the business provides agility and unity with far less effort and time.  One anecdotal example is the story of the regional bank.  They can visualize micro market conditions in their area, see how they stack up with their direct competitors, and then couple all of that information with past loan applications to train a machine learning model that identifies pockets of low risk loans that by traditional metrics wouldn’t have be considered.

I’m convinced that as SMBs begin taking full advantage of the productivity and analytics tools they’ll find themselves on a level playing field with the largest global conglomerates.  This isn’t the end of the giants, but the competitive advantage their advanced IT capabilities afforded for the past 20 years is off the table.
