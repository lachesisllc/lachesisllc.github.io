                The first introduction I had to technology was as an office manager
                of an ophthalmology office that used an SCO Xenix operating system. 
                The logic of the operating system made sense to me and I was drawn 
                to how it worked, how it was used, how it was configured, and how I 
                could learn more. The next 15 years of my career was spent 
                supporting, providing solutions and educating customers on the SCO 
                UNIX operating environment and related applications. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In 2004, realizing I needed a new challenge, my career took a major
                turn as I moved into sales. At that time, IKON had won awards based
                on their sales training. Given my experience in the office equipment
                industry, I joined the IKON team. I was sent to Houston for a two
                week sales class. Quickly applying that knowledge, I achieved 
                promotions within the first year and an increase in salary.
                </p>
                <p>
                Today, because of my unique career path, I possess a strong technical
                foundation coupled with an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the 
                sales process. I have migrated into sales leadership and look forward 
                to continuing to grow. The sales process that I learned is based on 
                empathy with a buyer in order to identify the best solution. This can 
                be applied to all aspects of life.
